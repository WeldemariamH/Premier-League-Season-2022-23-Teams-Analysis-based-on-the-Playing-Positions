# Premier-League-2022-23-Season-Teams-Analysis-based-on-the-Playing-Positions
# Overview
This project involves the analysis of football player data sourced from Kaggle. The data includes information about players, their performance, and various attributes related to different playing positions.

# Data Processing Steps
 1. **Data Download and Initial Exploration**
- Download raw CSV files from Kaggle
- Import files into Python for initial exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing
  
 2. **Initial Data Exploration and Cleaning in Python**
- Change column names for clarity
- Separate data based on playing positions
- Merge data to create separate files for each playing position

 3. **Further Processing in Excel**
- Exported data from Python to Excel
- Continued preprocessing in Excel:
  - Deleted unnecessary columns
  - Ensured the files contain only relevant data for each playing position

 # Analysis and Visualization in Power BI

 4. **Importing Data into Power BI**
- Imported cleaned and processed data files into Power BI for detailed analysis

 5. **Creating Visualizations**
- Created six pages in Power BI, each dedicated to analyzing teams performance in specific playing position:
  1. Goal Keeping Position
  2. Defending
  3. Defending Midfield
  4. Midfield
  5. Attacking Midfield
  6. Attacking
  
 6. **Visualizations**
- Designed various visualizations on each page to extract valuable insights on Team-wise performance in each Position

# Repository Structure
- `Final preprocessed datas/`: Contains the raw and processed data files.
- `Python file/`: Python scripts for data processing.
- `Raw datas/`: Excel files with further preprocessing.
- `powerbi Visualization/`: Power BI files with visualizations.

# How to Use 
to replicate or extend this analysis, follow these steps:

1.Data Exploration, Cleaning and Preprocessing: Execute the python script EPL 2022_23 'Python file/' in a Jupyter environment
